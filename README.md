# MetricDrivenNeuromorphics
This is the repository with the code and supplementary information of our paper "On Metric-Driven Development of Embedded Neuromorphic AI" at IEEE SOCC'24.

The requirements should be isntalled in a Python 3.9 environment. 
For execution, run either 

```bash
python3 main.py
```

or

```bash
python3 optuna_hps.py
```

with the respective desired flags.

If you use our work please cite it using the following citation

Lastly, it should be noted that the code contains some parts of the open source neuromorphic framwork Norse (https://github.com/norse/norse). It is written in the files whereever that is the case.
